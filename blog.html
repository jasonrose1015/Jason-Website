						<h2>My Plans for 2019</h2>
						<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/blog-banner.png" alt="" /></a>
						<p>While 2018 was a great year overall, I did not quite accomplish everything that I wanted. I did not learn as much about JavaScript as I had planned and I did not get my YouTube channel up and running again. I almost forgot why I made my channel. It was not to get a lot of views or make money (That would be an added bonus). I created my channel to help solve common computer issues and to review mid-range hardware and other tech. I want to help you make the right choices when buying tech or building a PC. So in 2019, I am going to get back to that.</p>
						<p>I am currently upgrading and doing a lot of work on PCs. I will start with videos that cover that and then move on to robotics. I just purchased the <a href="https://mekamon.com">MekaMon V2 </a> during the holiday break. I will be doing a series of videos over this awesome piece of tech soon as well! Last, I will be doing more videos over the tech that I purchase, which is usually a lot!</p>

						<p>I have been blessed with the responsibility of being a College and Career Navigator for PCS and I cannot wait to get started! My role will be to help students find their path in life after high school by finding the right college for them. I will also be responsible for helping them obtain industry certifications that will prepare them for a career. Last, but not least, I will also work with these students in computer science. They will learn how to code websites, drones and robots. I am very excited and cannot wait to get started working with them! So 2019 is set to be a great year!</p>

								<h3>DJI Spark Drone</h3>
								<p>I have been working with drones for a couple of years now. I purchased a<a href="https://www.parrot.com/us/drones/parrot-mambo-fpv#parrot-mambo-fpv-details"> Parrot Mambo FPV</a> a year ago. I have used Apple's Playgrounds app to learn the basics of coding drones. It is a very capable drone with a lot of great features. In the spring, I plan to upgrade to the DJI Spark so that I can get more aerial shots and record video of places that I travel. I will also be posting those videos on YouTube as well.</p>
